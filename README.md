# Code-The-Dream
Three <HTML> and <JS> files:
- orbit2d.html – shows the circular motion of two planets around the Sun.
- orbitFitAssignment.html – shows the motion of two planets around the Sun in a semi‑horizontal plane. The accompanying JS file must meet the test criteria.
- orbitSimpleCode.html – shows the motion of two planets around the Sun in a semi‑horizontal plane. The JS file performs the same task as in item 2, but in a much simpler way.
